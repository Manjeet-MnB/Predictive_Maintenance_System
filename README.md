Predictive Maintenance System
•Managed the entire data science project lifecycle, overseeing tasks such as data collection, cleaning,
and preprocessing, as well as engaging in feature engineering, model development, and deployment
to ensure a smooth flow of information.
•Developed advanced machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the health status of
machinery, classifying them into categories of good, moderate, or bad conditions.
•Implemented predictive maintenance strategies, resulting in a 30% reduction in unplanned
downtime and a 25% increase in overall equipment efficiency; proactively extended machinery
lifespan and saved $500k in maintenance expenses annually.
•This not only improved overall productivity but also contributed to a more sustainable and efficient
operation
